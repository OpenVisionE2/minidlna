# MiniDLNA for STB
This is a DLNA/UPnP-AV media server. Run as a daemon in Linux systems, such as Enigma2 based set-top boxes and OS like Ubuntu. The main focus here is to support STB systems, however support for other OS will be retained.
## History
The code in this repo was 2019 taken from the ReadyMedia project at http://sourceforge.net/projects/minidlna/. That is the formerly MiniDLNA software.
